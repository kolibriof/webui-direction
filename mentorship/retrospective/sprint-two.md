# Retrospective for Mentorship - 20.02.2023 - 27.03.2023

## What went well
- The educational project was completed and merged successfully.
- Dmytro demonstrated high productivity while completing additional tasks.
- Dmytro showed a strong desire for self-learning and was able to tackle complex tasks on his own.
- Dmytro answered interview questions related to HTML and CSS excellently.

## What didn't go well
- Lack of communication led to discrepancies in understanding tasks, as verbal communication without documenting changes occurred frequently.
- The skipping of phases resulted in a lot of code for review and correction.

## Areas for improvement
- Creating a summary sheet with the results of conversations for documentation purposes is necessary.
- More communication is needed to avoid discrepancies in understanding tasks.

## Goals for next sprint
1. In accordance with the planned phases (general refactoring, greetings section, calendar section view, context and progress section), Dmytro will create one pull request with an enhancement of the relevant phase. With regards to the context, the logic should align with the CRUD style.
2. Dmytro will make changes to the html-questions file, reformatting it into md format and closing the open pull request.
3. Dmytro will fix bugs discovered in the todo-list project. Each bug must be entered as a separate pull request and closed on GitHub.
4. Nazar will add questions about JavaScript.
5. Nazar will prepare a small task involving data handling (filtering, calculations, file handling).
6. After merging the first phase and refactoring from Dmytro, Nazar will start refactoring the modal part.
7. Dmytro will focus on the React course.
8. Dima will read about how to use the Call, Apply, and Bind functions efficiently in JavaScript.
